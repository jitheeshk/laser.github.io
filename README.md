## Laser Cutting and engraving

Laser engraving, which is a subset of laser marking is the practice of using lasers to engrave an object. Laser marking, on the other hand, is a broader category of methods to leave marks on an object, which also includes color change due to chemical/molecular alteration, charring, foaming, melting, ablation, and more. The technique does not involve the use of inks, nor does it involve tool bits which contact the engraving surface and wear out, giving it an advantage over alternative engraving or marking technologies where inks or bit heads have to be replaced regularly.

### Laser Engraving 
  * >First design the file in word or any similar tools .

  * >Now open the file in pdf and get ready for print . As the print dialog box appears use "Raster" and then set the speed at 20 and power at 85 . Now set the allignment and put for print .

## Moulding and casting

Molding or moulding is the process of manufacturing by shaping liquid or pliable raw material using a rigid frame called a mold or matrix.This itself may have been made using a pattern or model of the final object.A mold or mould is a hollowed-out block that is filled with a liquid or pliable material such as plastic, glass, metal, or ceramic raw material.The liquid hardens or sets inside the mold, adopting its shape. A mold is the counterpart to a cast. 

### Steps 

* > Prepare the mould . Mould could be prepared by any of the steps :<br/>
